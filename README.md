# eo, a neolithic conlang

An evocative language

These are the early notes of Eo, a whimsical conlang, I am designing for the fun of it, and the odd chance to incorporate it in a story. My goal with this language is to create something simple and evocative of what the habitants of Skara Brae could have spoken. Just that.

## The Fragment

As a first step in the design process I crafted a small story, which I call “the fragment”. The objective of this exercise is to envision how the Eo speaker actually spoke and then build the language around that. 

#### pa eirnik. naa niba i Erpek. epojeak. eer Ereik. nibaasEr epodoker do epoeok. "ur aak, naa aa. pa nidumosaa uok. jee olo sek jee olo er uok." Ereok. "dusef olo rek. ma mijesusupa mek. ma jee louk.."

[ES] Esos días era invierno. Er pescaba en el mar, solo, en su barca. Un pájaro-familia andaba en los espíritus. Er le saludó. El pájaro-familia bajó, se posó en su barca y habló. –Soy tu madre, la-del-mar. Ves mi tumba de olas. Si hoy te quedas, hoy me verás.  – Er respondió –Hoy vuelvo a casa. Hoy acariciaré tus sueños blancos. Mañana quizás muera.

[EN] It was winter those days. Er was fishing in the sea, alone, on his boat. A family-bird was walking in the spirits. Er greeted it. The family-bird went down, perched on the boat and spoke: “I am your mother, the-one-in-the-sea. You see  my tombs of waves. Perhaps you stay today, perhaps you will see me today”. Er answered. “I am returning home today. I will caress your white dreams today. Tomorrow perhaps I die.

Which sounds foreign, as it should be. A less literal translation could be something akin to: [English only]

Back then, it was winter. Er was at sea, fishing alone on his boat. An eagle, which we call family bird, for we believe they carry the spirits of our loved ones, was flying near by. Er greeted the eagle. The eagle went down and perched itself on Er’s boat and told him. “I am your mother, who died on this sea. Go back home unless you want to die today”. Er answered: “Thank you mother, I’m going back home right now, I will care for your bones until the day I die”.

## Script

Eo is not a written language, so it lacks a script. We use roman letters to represent its sounds, just as they sound in Spanish except that g always sound soft, like in English.

So we have five vowels which can be pronounced either short ( a, e, i, o, u ) or long ( aa, ee, ii, oo, uu ) and 14 consonants ( b, d, f, g, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, y)

## Some sentences

- lam an ik.  – I wish water and food.
- lam aik. – We (inclusive) want food.
- asluk – We (exclusive) are hungry.

- euk – You come.
- eirnik – It’s winter (pa eirnik – It was winter)
- nosifan ik - I wish you good night (or good night)
